Process Flows
============

This document describes the core processing flows in the Ananke2 knowledge framework.
The system processes documents through multiple stages to extract knowledge and build
a comprehensive knowledge graph.

Document Intake
==============

The document intake process handles initial document validation and acquisition:

* File Validation and Type Checking
    - Supported formats: PDF, TXT, DOCX
    - File size and content validation
    - MIME type verification using libmagic

* Document Downloading
    - arXiv paper download support
    - Local file handling
    - Error handling and retry mechanisms

Text Extraction
==============

Text extraction is handled by the unstructured.io library:

* Document Processing
    - CPU-only implementation for broad compatibility
    - Structured text extraction preserving layout
    - Section and paragraph identification
    - OCR support via Tesseract

* Content Organization
    - Text chunking for processing
    - Metadata extraction
    - Content cleaning and normalization

Knowledge Graph Generation
------------------------

Knowledge is extracted and organized using the Qwen API:

* Entity Extraction
    - Entity identification (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, GEO, EVENT, CONCEPT)
    - Entity attribute extraction
    - Entity deduplication and normalization

* Relationship Identification
    - Entity relationship detection
    - Relationship strength scoring (1-10)
    - Relationship type classification

* Graph Construction
    - Neo4j graph database storage
    - Entity and relationship persistence
    - Graph traversal optimization

Task Management
==============

Tasks are managed using Redis and Celery:

* Task Queue Management
    - Asynchronous task processing
    - Task prioritization
    - Progress tracking and monitoring

* Error Handling
    - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
    - Error logging and reporting
    - Task failure recovery

Data Storage
============

The system uses multiple databases for different aspects:

* Graph Database (Neo4j)
    - Knowledge graph storage
    - Entity and relationship persistence
    - Graph querying and traversal

* Vector Database (Chroma)
    - Text embedding storage
    - Semantic similarity search
    - Content retrieval

* Relational Database (MySQL)
    - Structured data storage
    - Metadata management
    - System configuration

API Integration
==============

External API integration is managed through dedicated clients:

* Qwen API Integration
    - Entity and relationship extraction
    - Text embedding generation
    - Rate limiting and retry handling

* arXiv API Integration
    - Paper metadata retrieval
    - PDF download management
    - Citation extraction

Monitoring and Logging
=====================

System monitoring provides operational visibility:

* Task Monitoring
    - Real-time task progress tracking
    - Worker status monitoring
    - Queue length and processing rates

* Error Tracking
    - Error aggregation and reporting
    - Performance monitoring
    - System health checks

Web Interface
============

The web interface provides visualization and interaction:

* Knowledge Graph Visualization
    - Interactive node and edge display
    - Entity relationship exploration
    - Path retrieval visualization

* Search Interface
    - Entity and relationship search
    - Content-based retrieval
    - Semantic similarity search

* Data Management
    - Document upload and processing
    - Entity and relationship editing
    - Knowledge graph maintenance

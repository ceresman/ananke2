## Knowledge Graph Extraction Tests

### Test Cases
1. Entity Type Extraction
   - Tests extraction of all supported entity types (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, GEO, EVENT, CONCEPT)
   - Validates entity format and structure
   - Example entity:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "CENTRAL INSTITUTION",
     "type": "ORGANIZATION",
     "description": "The Central Institution is the Federal Reserve of Verdantis"
   }
   ```

2. Relationship Extraction
   - Tests relationship extraction between entities
   - Validates relationship strength (1-10 scale)
   - Example relationship:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "MARTIN SMITH",
     "target": "CENTRAL INSTITUTION",
     "relationship": "Martin Smith is the Chair of the Central Institution",
     "relationship_strength": 9
   }
   ```

3. Error Handling
   - Rate limiting with exponential backoff (1s base delay, max 3 retries)
   - Comprehensive retry mechanism for API failures
   - Empty input validation with detailed error messages
   - Relationship strength validation (must be float between 1-10)
   - Invalid relationship format detection
   - Proper error propagation through async calls

4. Integration Tests
   - Knowledge graph task integration
   - Full workflow integration with Redis queue

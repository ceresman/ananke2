## Knowledge Graph Extraction Tests

### Test Cases
1. Entity Type Extraction
   - Tests extraction of all supported entity types (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, GEO, EVENT, CONCEPT)
   - Validates entity format and structure
   - Example entity:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "CENTRAL INSTITUTION",
     "type": "ORGANIZATION",
     "description": "The Central Institution is the Federal Reserve of Verdantis"
   }
   ```

2. Relationship Extraction
   - Tests relationship extraction between entities
   - Validates relationship strength (1-10 scale)
   - Example relationship:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "MARTIN SMITH",
     "target": "CENTRAL INSTITUTION",
     "relationship": "Martin Smith is the Chair of the Central Institution",
     "relationship_strength": 9
   }
   ```

3. Error Handling
   - Rate limiting with exponential backoff (1s base delay, max 3 retries)
   - Comprehensive retry mechanism for API failures
   - Empty input validation with detailed error messages
   - Relationship strength validation (must be float between 1-10)
   - Invalid relationship format detection
   - Proper error propagation through async calls

4. Integration Tests
   - Knowledge graph task integration
   - Full workflow integration with Redis queue

### Test Configuration
- Qwen API Key: sk-46e78b90eb8e4d6ebef79f265891f238
- API Base URL: https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
- Test Data: Sample text about Central Institution and Market Strategy Committee

### Test Results (Updated 2024-03-18)
- All 7 test cases passing successfully
- Rate limiting mechanism verified with exponential backoff (3 retries)
- Relationship strength validation improved with type checking
- Error handling enhanced for API failures and invalid inputs
- Integration with Redis task queue verified
- Test coverage includes all critical paths

### Recent Improvements
- Enhanced rate limiting logic with proper retry counting
- Improved relationship validation with strict type checking
- Added comprehensive error messages for validation failures
- Refactored test mocking strategy for better reliability
- Fixed edge cases in relationship strength validation

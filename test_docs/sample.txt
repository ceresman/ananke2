Abstract: Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applications.

The core LayoutParser library comes with interfaces for layout detection, character recognition, and document processing tasks. The library incorporates a community platform for sharing pre-trained models and document digitization pipelines.
